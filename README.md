# Guts Ticker Notifier 
## Ticket notifier app that notifies the user when a ticket is available on guts.events
* Build using selenium
* User gets notified by email using gmail
  - There seems to be a small delay of about 2-4 minutes, which is not ideal in this usecase

## To-do:
* Only notify user when a specific type of ticket is available
* notify user by using a discord bot in a discord server
